# Welcome to my Portfolio! 
## Learn all about me and my journey as a developer.
#### This is a web application designed using HTML, CSS, JS, and Bulma. Employers can use this page to learn about me, the projects I have worked on, view my various social media accounts, and download my current resume.

## Motivation

For this updated version of my portfolio I wanted a clean design that highlighted my progress as a new developer. I used the Bulma CSS framework in conjunction with vanilla CSS to create the design of the site, and added some JS functionality to the menu that appears when the site is viewed on mobile devices. I also added a link to my resume that employers can click to download a copy of my resume. 

#### Technologies
* HTML
* CSS 
* JavaScript
* Bulma

## Functionality

#### The demo shows the main functions of my Portfolio:
* Users can navigate the site using the Explore dropdown menu.
* Projects are displayed as animated gifs, and include links to the deployed sites and the GitHub repositories. 
* When a user click on the resume, a copy is downloaded onto their device.
* GitHub and LinkedIn profiles are updated.
* The Contact Me section includes links to GitHub, LinkedIn, and Twitter, as well as my email address and a form for asking questions.

## Challenges
The main challenge I faced with this project was deigning a mobile-first site. I wanted my portfilio to look and function well on mobile devices, and spent a lot of time making sure the site functioned on smaller screens. 

## Usage
* Employers can quickly see my projects and resume.  
* Employers can get a sense of my visual design skills. 
* Employers can use the "Contact Me" section to see my social media accounts, ask questions, and email me. 

## Future Development
* Add functionality to send an email whenever a user asks a question in the Contact Me section. 
* Include animations to make the projects section look better.
